### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You've caught meâ€”I'm just another wild, code-wielding conjurer in this magical land of GitHub. To sum it up, I juggle between coding, occasional snacking, napping (when time allows), and spinning tales of everyday life (such a gracious quartet).

My heart races for crafting and experimenting with mind-bending tech creations. ðŸš€âœ¨

I build conversational chatbots at [BotOffice](https://botoffice.com), and also a tech farmer at [Porkfund](https://porkfund.com).
