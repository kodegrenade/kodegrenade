### Hi there 👋

Yes, you're right I'm just another random Software Engineer on github. A summary of what I do is "I code, eat, sleep (sometimes) and write domestic gossip for local consumption."

I like building and testing amazing tech products. 🧑‍💻

I'm currently making my contributions to improve Pig farming in Nigeria through [Porkfund](https://porkfund.com) 🐖💰
